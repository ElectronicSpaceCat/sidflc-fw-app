# Firmware

Suggested project folder structure:

```
hcld/
├── gcc-arm-none-eabi
├── nRF_SDK
├── nrfutil.exe
├── sidflc-fw-app
├── sidflc-fw-bootloader
└── prod_hex_merge.bat/sh
```

The firmware prod_sidflc_app.hex is a merge of the app + softdevice + bootloader + bootloader settings. The prod_hex_merge.bat will do this but the nrfutil.exe is required to run it. The path to the utility in the script should point to its location on your system.

The nrfutil can be found here:

The nRF5 SDK is required to build the project. Modify the makefile SDK paths to point to its location on your system.

The SDK can be downloaded here:

ARM toolchain Version 10.3-2021.10 (the latest verison would likely work too)

Segger J-Link is recommended for flashing the firmwar over the device's SWD pins on the main pcb.


## TODO
